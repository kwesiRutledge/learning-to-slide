# Experiment: Full CLF Attractivity

In this experiment, we attempt to identify the logic that will make the intermediate set for the full sliding system attractive.
We will assume:
* that the friction parameter IS known
* that we can arbitrarily place an approximately quadratic CLF anywhere
* we have unlimited force constraints
